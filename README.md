# Snips

## About

This is yet another docker image for the [Snips Voice Assistant](https://snips.ai/). Unlike the other images this tries to:
- use individual tags for each Nightscout release
- use Docker Hub's auto build feature
- run one daemon per container using the same base image
- support multi room setups using a [Satellite Configuration](https://docs.snips.ai/articles/platform/satellites)
- keep it up to date

This image is loosly based on [David Bilay's](https://github.com/dYalib) [snips-docker repository](https://github.com/dYalib/snips-docker).


## Prerequisites

You need to have a host running [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).


## Deployment

TBD
